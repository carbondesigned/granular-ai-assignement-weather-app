# Granular.ai Frontend Dev Weather Assignment

## **How it works**

You'll be greeted with an input of which you can search any city and or country for the current weather.

## **Your favorites**

When a location is searched, you'll have the opportunity to add that location to your favorites. Favorites will be located on their own page, where you can easily navigate to.

Favorites will show the current weather as card form to be easily displayed.

In addition when visiting the favorites page, you will have the ability to delete a location from the list.

## **Reflection**

As I followed the brief given very strictly, and I was able to complete most of the objectives. The only issue that is still present, is the ability to add more than one location to favorites list.

Through the process of developing this was one of the first bugs I encountered and I constantly tried to learn by researching through many forums and articles, etc. I could not find a fix to push more than one object in the array after changing the state.

Thank you for the opportunity, I would appreciate any feedback and or criticism.
